# Airline-dataset-to-predict-flight-delays-
An airline dataset to predict if there will be a flight delay or not.

# Introduction

Delay in flight is an inevitable phenomenon which has significant negative economic effects on airports, passengers and travel agencies. A flight delay is when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its scheduled time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. 

# Problem Statement
With this study, we aim at predicting if a flight will be delayed or not depending on the factors that we will analyze. Predicting flight delays will help improve airline operations and attain passenger satisfaction, which will result in a positive economic impact on passengers, airlines, airports and travel agencies.
This is a study on airline dataset with the aim of assisting airlines, airports and passangers in predicting if a flight will be delayed or not.
It is aimed at making all parties make better decisions and thus streamline the whole flying experience.

# Research Questions

Which airline has the most delays.

Which airport there were most delays.

What was the average delay time for each airline.

Which day of the week had the most delays.

Is a relationship/ correlation between the airport and airline which may lead to delays in flights.

# Metrics of success

Read and explore the given dataset.

Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Performing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.

Performing Decision tree, KNN, Naive Bayes models and choosing the best model with the highest f1 score with an improvement of both classes.

Providing recommendation based the analysis.

Challenge the solution of our best with a different model.
